read csv file
assign column headers from first line
one row at a time:
    parse and assign to varaibles
        fields
            verticalSpace - 2 digits, 1/10 inch
            horizontalSpace - 2 digits, 1/10 inch
            length
            diameter
            pinPitch - calculated in mmm
            powerRating - in watts
            refOffsetX = -.5(pinPitch)
            refOffsetY = -(1/2 verticalSpace and then to the next tenth)
            valueOffsetX = .5(pinPitch)
            valueOffsetY = 1/2 verticalSpace and then to the next tenth
            Datasheet
            value
            footprint
            digikey part Number
            manufacture part Number
            diameter
            
            power rating
            Price
            Tolerance


    from size, check to see if foot print exist
    do all math (mostly for foot print)
    if not then make foot print and save it
    make part
    repeat

will need 
    import cvs
    from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader
